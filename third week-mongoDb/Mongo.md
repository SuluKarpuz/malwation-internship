## Aggregation

Aggregation in MongoDB is a powerful tool for processing large amounts of data and returning computed results. It involves passing documents through different stages in a pipeline, where each stage can filter, sort, group, reshape, and modify the data.

Here's an example of an aggregation pipeline that calculates the total order quantity of medium-size pizzas grouped by pizza name:

```javascript
db.orders.aggregate([
  { $match: { size: "medium" } }, // Filter pizza order documents by pizza size
  { $group: { _id: "$name", totalQuantity: { $sum: "$quantity" } } }, // Group and calculate total quantity
]);
```

Other common use cases of aggregation include calculating aggregate values for groups of documents, performing relational-like joins, and more.

**Important Stages of the Aggregation Pipeline:**

- `$match`: Filters the documents to pass only those that match the specified condition.
- `$group`: Groups the documents by a specified expression and can calculate aggregate values for each group.
- `$project`: Reshapes the documents by including, excluding, or renaming fields.
- `$sort`: Sorts the documents by a specified field.
- `$limit`: Limits the number of documents passed to the next stage.
- `$skip`: Skips a specified number of documents and passes the rest to the next stage.
- `$unwind`: Deconstructs an array field from the input documents and outputs one document for each element of the array.

## Data Modeling

Data modeling in MongoDB involves creating a clean data model to store data in a database. Deciding between embedded data models (for "contains" relationships) and reference data models (for many-to-many relationships) is crucial.

**Examples of Data Modeling Patterns:**

- Model Relationships Between Documents
- Model One-to-One Relationships with Embedded Documents
- Model One-to-Many Relationships with Embedded Documents
- Model One-to-Many Relationships with Document References
- Model Tree Structures
- Model Tree Structures with Parent References

## Indexing

Indexing in MongoDB improves query performance by creating efficient representations of documents. Proper indexing leads to faster queries.

**Best Practices for Indexing:**

- Use compound indexes to support queries searching multiple fields.
- Follow the ESR (Equality, Sort, Range) rule when creating indexes.
- Use covered queries whenever possible.
- Utilize the MongoDB Atlas Performance Advisor for query optimization.

## Transactions

Transactions in MongoDB group multiple operations into a single unit that either succeeds or fails as a whole. This ensures atomicity when performing related operations.

**Example of a Transaction:**

```javascript
session = db.getMongo().startSession();
session.startTransaction();

try {
  db.orders.updateOne({ _id: 1 }, { $inc: { count: -1 } });
  db.orders.updateOne({ _id: 2 }, { $inc: { count: 1 } });
  session.commitTransaction();
} catch (error) {
  session.abortTransaction();
}
```

Transactions are useful for maintaining data integrity when multiple related updates need to be performed.
